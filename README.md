# block-13-if-else
introduction to if statements Fullstack Academy bootcamp.

The first commit explains why and how to use for loops on a
if assignment to evaluate each values.

The first two assignments where created with several if/ else if statements.
Each else-if statement have different conditions so we can chose the right output.

Almost all assignments have one logical operator (|| or &&) to check if both or at 
least one of the conditions are met.

Last two have a boolean output so its easier to use the ternary statement with logical operators.
