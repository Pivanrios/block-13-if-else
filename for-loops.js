//Hello I know a little of JS and I wanna explain how
//for loops work and why Im using it in this assignment.
//for loops let you iterate as many times as needed.
//For the assignment we have a list of values that need to be evaluated.
//we are gonna create an array with the values to evaluate.
const valuesToEvaluate = [1 ,3 ,"3","Hello", false, null]
        //index begins at 0  1   2...               ...n-1
//we create a for loop that goes tru each element of the array 
//we initialize with a for
for (i = 0; i < valuesToEvaluate.length; i++){
//index starts; while index is less than    ;add one to index
//    at 0    the length of array keep going
    console.log(i)//print index
}
